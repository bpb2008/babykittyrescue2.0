# Baby Kitty Rescue Committee 2.0

The second iteration of the Baby Kitty Rescue Committee website redesign. A full-stack application built with Next.js, TypeScript, NextAuth.js, PostgreSQL, Deizzle, and Neon.

Beyond displaying the current information on the original site, the owner would have the ability to login to an admin account and edit information as necessary.
